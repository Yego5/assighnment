    <h1>The future of Software Development</h1>
    <p>If you’re considering a career in software engineering, there’
        s no better time to get involved. This field is experiencing 
        enormous growth across the United States and around the world.
         According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),
          the number of job opportunities in software development 
          is projected to increase 22% from 2020 to 2030, much higher than 
          the projected national average growth rate for all professions of 8%. 
          These numbers point to the bright future of software engineering,
           especially as new software development trends continue to fuel the 
           profession’s progress.

    <h3>Trends in Software Development</h3>
    <p>
        The push for innovation in the technology sector is unlike any other, which is a big 
        reason why software developers are in such high demand. These are some  of the most 
        noteworthy future trends expected to change the current landscape.

    <ol>
        <li><b>Cloud Service</b>
            <p>Moving to a cloud-based service isn’t just a possibility for most businesses;
                 it’s practically inevitable. Although cloud computing has been around for 
                 some time, it’s now emerging as a viable hosting option for businesses in 
                 many different sectors. Companies such as <b>Facebook, General Electric, 
                    eBay,</b> and <b>Fitbit</b> have already fully adopted cloud-based technology, 
                    which has motivated other companies to follow suit.
                <h5>
                    Common Cloud Service Providers include:
                </h5>
                <ol type="i">
                 <li>AWS</li>
                 <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
                 <li>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
            <p>No future trends list would be complete without artificial intelligence.
                 Although long discussed in theoretical terms, it’s only recently begun 
                 to show promise with practical applications. We see these in the form 
                 of voice assistants, chatbots, and other AI-enabled devices designed 
                 to make our daily lives more convenient.
                AI has allowed companies to automate menial tasks, perform complex analyses, 
                and reduce <b><i>human-made errors, among other benefits.</i></b></p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Blockchain Technology</b>
            <p>Now that blockchain technology has proven itself in the world of cryptocurrency with Bitcoin and its descendants, other industries are realizing its true potential. The strength of blockchain is that it establishes trust between parties using transparency and security, hence its appeal to the banking industry. However, its applications go far beyond the financial sector. The shared, immutable ledgers blockchain employs can be used for car sales, land purchases, or intangible items such as copyrights or intellectual property.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Cyber Security
            <p>Cybersecurity remains a top priority for companies that need to protect valuable data from hackers and cybercriminals. Financial institutions especially need to be able to assure their customers that their data is secure behind an uncrackable digital lock, which is why the cybersecurity industry remains a popular field for 
                developers.</p>
